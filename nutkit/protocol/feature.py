    # === OPTIMIZATIONS ===
    # On receiving Neo.ClientError.Security.AuthorizationExpired, the driver
    # shouldn't reuse any open connections for anything other than finishing
    # a started job. All other connections should be re-established before
    # running the next job with them.
    OPT_AUTHORIZATION_EXPIRED_TREATMENT = "AuthorizationExpiredTreatment"
    # The driver caches connections (e.g., in a pool) and doesn't start a new
    # one (with hand-shake, HELLO, etc.) for each query.
    OPT_CONNECTION_REUSE = "Optimization:ConnectionReuse"
    # The driver first tries to SUCCESSfully BEGIN a transaction before calling
    # the user-defined transaction function. This way, the (potentially costly)
    # transaction function is not started until a working transaction has been
    # established.
    OPT_EAGER_TX_BEGIN = "Optimization:EagerTransactionBegin"
    # Driver doesn't explicitly send message data that is the default value.
    # This conserves bandwidth.
    OPT_IMPLICIT_DEFAULT_ARGUMENTS = "Optimization:ImplicitDefaultArguments"

    OPT_MINIMAL_VERIFY_AUTHENTICATION = \
        "Optimization:MinimalVerifyAuthentication"
    # (Bolt 5.1+) The driver doesn't wait for a SUCCESS after HELLO but
    # pipelines a LOGIN right afterwards and consumes two messages after.
    # Likewise, doesn't wait for a SUCCESS after LOGOFF and the following
    # LOGON but pipelines it with the next message and consumes all three
    # responses at once.
    # Each saves a full round-trip.
    OPT_AUTH_PIPELINING = "Optimization:AuthPipelining"
    # The driver doesn't wait for a SUCCESS after calling RUN but pipelines a
    # PULL right afterwards and consumes two messages after that. This saves a
    # full round-trip.

    # This feature requires `API_RESULT_LIST`.
    # The driver pulls all records (`PULL -1`) when Result.list() is called.
    # (As opposed to iterating over the Result with the configured fetch size.)
    # Note: If your driver supports this, make sure to document well that this
    #       method ignores the configures fetch size. Your users will
    #       appreciate it <3.

        "Detail:DefaultSecurityConfigValueEquality"

    # === CONFIGURATION HINTS (BOLT 4.3+) ===
    # The driver understands and follow the connection hint
    # connection.recv_timeout_seconds which tells it to close the connection
    # after not receiving an answer on any request for longer than the given
    # time period. On timout, the driver should remove the server from its
    # routing table and assume all other connections to the server are dead
    # as well.
    CONF_HINT_CON_RECV_TIMEOUT = "ConfHint:connection.recv_timeout_seconds"

    # === BACKEND FEATURES FOR TESTING ===
    # The backend understands the FakeTimeInstall, FakeTimeUninstall and
    # FakeTimeTick protocol messages and provides a way to mock the system
    # time. This is mainly used for testing various timeouts.
    BACKEND_MOCK_TIME = "Backend:MockTime"
    # The backend understands the GetRoutingTable protocol message and provides
    # a way for TestKit to request the routing table (for testing only, should
    # not be exposed to the user).
    BACKEND_RT_FETCH = "Backend:RTFetch"
    # The backend understands the ForcedRoutingTableUpdate protocol message
    # and provides a way to force a routing table update (for testing only,
    # should not be exposed to the user).
